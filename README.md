# MyBatis 3 + Spring Boot

![MyBatis + Spring Boot banner](https://github.com/Pio-Trek/mybatis-xml-spring-boot/blob/master/art/banner.png)

Sample project showing the integration of the MyBatis (Java persistence framework) with Spring Boot using XML mapper file.<br />
Unlike ORM frameworks, MyBatis does not map Java objects to database tables but Java methods to SQL statements.<br />
MyBatis lets you use all your database functionality like stored procedures, views, queries of any complexity and vendor proprietary features. It is often a good choice for legacy or de-normalized databases or to obtain full control of SQL execution.
